• Isak's departure was seen as a shock move, especially after he had signed a long-term deal with the club three years ago, and Gillespie thinks that Isak is lucky to have already joined Liverpool because his next visit to St James' Park will be more difficult for him.
• The former player believes that the players at Newcastle hold more power than the club's management, citing examples like Andy Cole leaving in 1995 but Les Ferdinand arriving within six months, and Alan Shearer joining after a year of Ferdinand being at the club.

Here are 3-5 bullets focusing on Newcastle United:

* David Hopkinson, the new CEO of Newcastle United, will need to make significant decisions regarding player contracts in 2026, particularly with eight players seeing their current deals expire.
* Key players whose contracts are up for discussion include Kieran Trippier, Fabian Schar, Nick Pope, and Jamaal Lascelles, with Hopkinson potentially being involved in some major decisions on who gets a new contract and what it will entail.
* Despite the importance of these players to the squad, Newcastle are unlikely to be able to sell or cash-in on them due to their significant value and loyalty to the club.

Summary:

URL: https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tarnished-nobby-solano-sends-strong-32427229

Summary:
Here are 3-5 bullets summarizing Nobby Solano's comments about Alexander Isak and Newcastle United:

• Nobby Solano believes that Alexander Isak has "tarnished" his legacy at Newcastle United by refusing to train or play for the club, despite having a £130m move to Saudi Arabia on deadline day.
• Solano feels that Isak could have become Newcastle's record scorer, surpassing Alan Shearer's 206 goals, but instead prioritized personal financial gain over loyalty and commitment to the club.
• Solano notes that player power has taken over in modern football, with significant salaries making contracts less meaningful, and suggests that Isak may be missing out on his potential at Newcastle.
• Solano praises Newcastle United for their recent successes, including winning the Carabao Cup last year and reaching the Champions League, which he believes would have been a great opportunity for Isak to shine.
• The former Newcastle player implies that Isak's actions will not be forgiven by Geordie fans, who feel insulted by his refusal to play for the club, especially given the warm welcome he received when joining the Magpies.
