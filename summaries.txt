Summary:
Here are 3-5 bullets focusing on Newcastle United:

• Newcastle United may have had a lucky escape in signing forward Benjamin Sesko from Manchester United, who scored his first goal for the Red Devils in their 3-1 defeat to Brentford. However, the Magpies initially agreed a deal with RB Leipzig for the Slovenian striker before Man United's interest cooled him down.

• Newcastle lost out on two other players of interest to Man United: Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Both players were signed by the Red Devils, although Cunha had made it clear early on that he intended to leave Wolves for Old Trafford.

• Newcastle was able to sign Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa before the transfer window closed, with Woltemade scoring on his debut against Wolves. However, Wissa will have to wait until after the October international break to make his debut due to a knee injury.

• The team's struggles in signing key players are a stark contrast to their success in the transfer market last summer, when they lost out on Mbeumo, Cunha, and Sesko three times.

Summary:
Here are 3-5 bullets summarizing the article, focusing on Newcastle United:

• Eddie Howe has decided to play Nick Woltemade as a striker (9) rather than a number 10, citing his creative flair and technical skills, which differ from previous strikers like Callum Wilson.

• Howe acknowledges that replacing Alexander Isak with a 6ft 6in striker like Woltemade will require adaptation from the coaching team and his teammates, but expects to find ways to maximize Woltemade's strengths in terms of creative flair and technical skill.

• To improve Woltemade's performance, Howe wants him to become more of a penalty box predator and score goals, building on his recent impressive display against Wolves where he scored a header and finished with a high-level finish.

• Despite the initial struggles, Howe sees huge potential in Woltemade and expects him to help create chances and score goals for Newcastle United as they move forward in the season.

• Osula had been in advanced talks with Eintracht Frankfurt and had come close to being loaned out with a view to a permanent deal, but the move ultimately fell through at the 11th hour.

• However, Howe has now granted Osula more opportunities, which have resulted in him becoming top scorer for Newcastle this season on three goals, and he is pushing for a start against Arsenal.

• Osula's goal celebrations against Liverpool had drawn attention to his frustration with coaching staff, but Howe believes the striker has taken those emotions in stride and is progressing well under the club's guidance.

• With Osula now performing well, Howe hints that the Dane could be in line for a starting spot against Arsenal, which would do him "the world of good" on many levels.
